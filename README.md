# Blockchain-Based Specialized Artisanal Food Verification

A decentralized platform for authenticating, tracing, and certifying artisanal food products from producer to consumer.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create transparent, immutable records that verify the authenticity of artisanal food products. Through four interconnected smart contracts, the platform validates producer credentials, ingredient sourcing, traditional production methods, and compliance with artisanal standards, addressing growing consumer demand for transparency and authenticity in specialty food markets.

## Core Components

### 1. Producer Verification Contract

Validates legitimate small-scale food makers through:
- Artisan identity verification and credentials
- Production capacity documentation
- Family heritage and tradition records
- Geographic location verification
- Production facility certification
- Small-scale operation validation
- Craftsperson qualifications and training
- Historical production documentation

### 2. Ingredient Sourcing Contract

Tracks origin and quality of raw materials:
- Farm and supplier verification
- Harvest dates and batch identification
- Geographical origin certification
- Organic/biodynamic certification
- Heirloom variety documentation
- Wild-harvested ingredient tracking
- Sustainable sourcing practices
- Seasonal availability confirmation
- Fair trade verification

### 3. Production Method Contract

Documents traditional techniques used:
- Step-by-step process documentation
- Time-honored methodology verification
- Hand-crafting confirmation
- Traditional equipment usage
- Fermentation/aging durations
- Temperature and humidity monitoring
- Ancestral recipe adherence
- Non-industrial process verification
- Batch size limitations

### 4. Certification Contract

Verifies compliance with artisanal standards:
- Regional denomination protection
- Traditional specialty certification
- Quality assurance testing
- Sensory evaluation results
- Small-batch verification
- Additive-free confirmation
- Non-industrial process validation
- Third-party inspector verification
- Renewal and audit scheduling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- Node.js v16.0+
- Truffle Suite v5.0+
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS for decentralized storage of certificates and media

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/artisanal-food-verification.git
   cd artisanal-food-verification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to your preferred network:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network [network-name]
   ```

## Usage

### For Artisanal Producers

1. Register as a verified producer with credentials and documentation
2. Record ingredient sourcing with supplier verification
3. Document production processes with timestamped evidence
4. Obtain and maintain relevant certifications
5. Generate QR codes for product packaging
6. Update batch information with each production run

### For Certifying Organizations

1. Establish verification criteria on the platform
2. Conduct and document audits
3. Issue blockchain-secured certificates
4. Schedule and track renewal processes
5. Monitor compliance across producer network

### For Distributors and Retailers

1. Verify product authenticity before purchase
2. Access complete production history
3. Confirm certification status in real-time
4. Provide transparency information to customers
5. Trace products back to specific production batches

### For Consumers

1. Scan product QR codes to access verification data
2. View producer credentials and story
3. Explore ingredient sources and quality
4. Learn about traditional production methods
5. Verify certifications and standards compliance

## API Reference

The system provides REST APIs for integration with existing inventory and production systems:

- `POST /api/producer/verify` - Register as a verified producer
- `GET /api/producer/:id` - Get producer verification details
- `POST /api/ingredient/source` - Record ingredient sourcing
- `GET /api/ingredient/:batchId` - Get ingredient sourcing details
- `POST /api/production/document` - Record production methods
- `GET /api/production/:batchId` - Get production documentation
- `POST /api/certification/issue` - Issue new certification
- `GET /api/certification/:producerId` - Get certification status

## Architecture

The system implements a hybrid architecture:
- On-chain: Core verification data, certification status, and event hashes
- Off-chain: High-resolution images, detailed documentation, and video evidence (IPFS hashes stored on-chain)

Smart contracts use role-based access control to ensure only authorized entities can modify records.

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for certification issuance
- Time-stamped evidence requirements
- Integration with physical verification methods (QR/NFC)
- Regular security audits recommended
- Privacy considerations for producer trade secrets

## Future Enhancements

- IoT sensor integration for real-time production monitoring
- Climate impact calculation and carbon footprint tracking
- Consumer feedback and rating system
- Marketplace integration for verified products
- Mobile app for streamlined producer documentation
